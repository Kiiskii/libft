## Features

- **Custom Implementations**: Recreates essential standard library functions.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into string, memory, and utility modules.
- **Reusable Code**: Designed for integration into larger projects.
- **Tests**: Includes tests to ensure everything works correctly.

## Usage

Clone the repository and compile using the included Makefile.

## Improvement points

There are some functions I might clean up a bit, I don't really like the logic I used.
I want to make sure that I handle my write return values properly incase of errors.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kiiskii/libft.git
cd libft
make
